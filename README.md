# machine-learning
Artifacts generated by my attempts to learn something about machine learning

Mostly by exploring the concepts in this book:

I've attempted to map the ideas to OO/Java, so I can get a better understanding of the moving parts.

At some point, I'll probably rewrite them in a more efficient way, either in Python or perhaps Java, or some other ML industry-standard language.
